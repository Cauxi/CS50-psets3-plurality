<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Plurality" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/plurality/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem set, I implemented a program that runs a simple plurality election. The program allows voters to cast votes for candidates and then determines the winner(s) based on who received the most votes. If there’s a tie, it prints all candidates with the highest number of votes.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input</strong>: The program takes the names of candidates as command-line arguments and then allows voters to vote for a candidate by typing their name.</li> <li><strong>Vote Counting</strong>: The program tracks votes and updates the count for each candidate.</li> <li><strong>Winner Determination</strong>: It determines the candidate(s) with the highest vote count and prints their names as the winner(s).</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Command-line Input</strong>: The program accepts command-line arguments representing the candidates' names.</li> <li><strong>Vote Function</strong>: The `vote` function is called every time a voter casts a vote. It checks whether the voted name is valid and updates the candidate’s vote count if it is.</li> <li><strong>Print Winner Function</strong>: After all votes are cast, the `print_winner` function determines who has the most votes and prints the winner. In case of a tie, it prints all candidates with the highest vote count.</li> <li><strong>Vote Validation</strong>: The program checks if the voted candidate exists and rejects invalid votes.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as the Makefile or sample inputs.</p>
